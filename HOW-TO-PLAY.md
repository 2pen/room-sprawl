Move from room to room by clicking the North, South, East, and West navigation buttons. 

A room might contain an item that can be picked up. Only one item can be carried at a time, so if you already have an item it will be swapped for the new item. 

### Unlocking rooms
A locked room unlocks if the player is currently carrying the required item. If there is another item inside this room, the player can perform a swap and thereby permanently unlocking the room (or at least until the item is removed again). 

### Goal
There is no specific goal in this "game", but one might argue that getting 100% rooms discovered could become a bit of a challenge as more and more rooms are added.
