Move from room to room by clicking the North, South, East, and West navigation buttons
Or using the Keys UP, DOWN, RIGHT and LEFT for North, South, East and West respectively.
You can pick up an item using the Return key or the Space bar!

A room might contain an item that can be picked up. Only one item can be carried at a time, so if you already have an item it will be swapped for the new item. 

### Unlocking rooms
A locked room unlocks if the player is currently carrying the required item. If there is another item inside this room, the player can perform a swap and thereby permanently unlocking the room (or at least until the item is removed again). 

### Goal
There is no specific goal in this "game", but one might argue that getting 100% rooms discovered could become a bit of a challenge as more and more rooms are added.
